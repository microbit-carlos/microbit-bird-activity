# Bird Pipe Cleaners

Take this quiz to find out what kind of bird you are!

Well, no really, but you have a few options available.
What kind of bird do you fancy making? ü¶ú ü¶â üê•  ü¶Ö

These YouTube tutorials are relatively short and show how to make
these cool birds. A couple of the options also have step by step
instructions with screenshots, but the video is likely easier to understand.

### Individual steps screenshots

The best way to make this bird is by following the video. These steps might
be helpful for a second round of bird making.

<br>
To make the body bend two pipe cleaners by half:

<br>
Then bend the folded end to make to shape the beak:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/2.jpg" width="49%">

<br>
Grab two strands from the four available, and wrap them around the top of
the other two to form a head next to the beak:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/3.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/4.jpg" width="49%">

<br>
Now grab a new pipe cleaner, and wrap it around the head to make it thicker:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/5.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/6.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

Take one of the cotton balls and place it below the head to form the body by
wrapping a pipe cleaner around it:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/7.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/8.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/9.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

To make the feet take a new pipe cleaner of a different colour,
fold it in half and bend the end in the shape shown by the screenshots:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/10.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/11.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/11-5.png" width="49%">

<br>

Wrap the other end around the body of the bird:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/12.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/13.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

To make the wings, bend a new pipe cleaner (remember can pick a different
colour) in half

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/14.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

Bend each half as shown here, and twist the middle to keep the shape in place:
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/14-0.png" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/15.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/16.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

Take another pipe cleaner and interlace it on the inside of the wings.
You'll need at least a couple per wing.

This step is easier to watch, this YouTube link starts at this point:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/18.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/19.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

To attach the wings to the body, use another pipe cleaner and wrap it around
the neck of the bird and the wings connecting middle:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/21.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube1/22.jpg" width="49%">

And we've got a bird!

### Individual steps screenshots

The best way to make this bird is by following the video. These steps might
be helpful for a second round of bird making.

<br>
Start with a single pipe cleaner and start rolling it in this shape:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/1.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/2.jpg" width="49%">

<br>
We don't have scissors to cut the peak, but there are a few pre-cut bits in
the box:
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/3.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

Get a new pipe cleaner, pass it through the center of the body,
and bend it in half:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/4.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/5.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/6.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

For each half, bend it into three triangles to form each foot:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/8.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/10-5.png" width="49%">

<br>

Glue the peak and googly eye:

<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/11.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="/microbit-bird-activity/img/youtube3/12.jpg" width="49%">

<br>

And there we go!
