# BBC micro:bit Bird Activity

Hi! 👋

Welcome to the micro:bit Bird Activity page.

## What will we do today? 🤷‍♂️

With this micro:bit activity we will:

1. Build a bird, with pipe cleaners (optional but really fun!)
2. Program the bird with the help of a `bird.py` module
    - And we are going to use the new micro:bit Python Editor!
3. Think like a bird and decide how a  bird reacts to events in the world and
  as part of the flock


## Website Navigation 🧭

But first, let's make sure we can find where things are.

We tried to make the contents of this website easy to find, but if something is
missing or hard to find look around for one of the micro:bit helpers and
we'll be happy to help with anything :)

In short:

- ⬅️ The navigation menu on the left has a link to each available page
- ➡️ Each page has a table of contents on the right to jump to each section


## What you'll need ☑️

To go through this activity you'll need:

- 1 laptop
- 1 micro:bit
- 1 USB cable
- 1 battery holder (optional)
- 1 bird of your making (optional, but really fun!)


## micro:bit Python Editor 🐍

For this activity we are going to use the brand new micro:bit Python Editor.

On top of that, we are going to load it with a special flag to enable even
more new features, which you will be one of the first people to check out!

[https://python.microbit.org/v/beta?flag=audioSoundEffect](https://python.microbit.org/v/beta?flag=audioSoundEffect)

You can find more information about the editor in the
[Python Editor page](editor).


## Birds! 🦜 🐥 🦉

And we are going to make some birds using some craft supplies.

Don't worry, if this is not your thing you can still try all this would the
bird, but it is a lot more fun with one!

To see some bird making examples see the 
[Bird Pipe Cleaners page](birdcraft).


## Coding Activity 👩‍💻

And now that we are all ready, let's get coding!

Check out the [Coding Activity page](activity).


## Make some noise! 🔊

One of the other brand new features we are showcasing today is the creation
of Sound Effects!

This is a new feature we've added to MicroPython and we'd love to see what you
can do with it.

We are in the process of making the pre-build Sound Effect that will ship with
MicroPython for the micro:bit, for users to  start with, so if you have a good SoundEffect you'd like to suggest, please
[submit them here](https://microbit-carlos.github.io/microbit-bird-activity/submitse/).
