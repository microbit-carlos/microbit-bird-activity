# Submit your SoundEffects

TODO: Intro about why Sound Effects are cool and how to experiment with them.

We are in the process of creating the default Sound Effects that will be
included in the micro:bit MicroPython runtime, and we would love your help!

We're taking submissions from the community for cool sound effects that show
off the range of sounds you can make with the new APIs.

If you have a Sound Effect you'd like to submit you can follow these steps:

- [Fork](https://github.com/microbit-carlos/microbit-bird-activity/fork) the https://github.com/microbit-carlos/microbit-bird-activity/
  repository
- Create a copy of the `template.py` python file in the `sound-effect-examples`
  folder, and give it a new name.
    - This is important so that we can give you credit for your contribution
    - The MicroPython source code is under the MIT license, so using this
      license for the contributions is the easiest option
- Replace the "Your-name-goes-here" placeholder in the copyright line with
  name
- You can add as many Sound Effects as you like into the same file
- Remember to play them at the bottom of the file
- Submit the PR 

We appreciate every single submission, but as he micro:bit has limited
resources we can only include a few effects in total.
But don't worry, if we can't include your effect into the MicroPython build,
it will still be available in this repository and they will be showcased in
future versions of this workshop.
